# Beauty-and-Joy-of-Computing August 2013
A broad-based introduction to key concepts and principles of computer science. Exploration of seven big ideas of computing; creativity, abstraction, data, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and impact of computing.

- use programming and computing tools in creative expression, creating and analyzing artifacts (creativity);
- devise and use multiple levels of abstraction in computation, including the use of models and simulations to raise and answer questions (abstraction);
- use computing to examine large datasets and facilitate exploration in order to gain insight and knowledge (data and information);
- devise, express, and evaluate algorithms for solving computational problems (algorithms);
- create and evaluate a correct program to implement an algorithm, using abstraction to manage complexity (programming);
- explain characteristics of the Internet and systems built on it, including issues of cybersecurity and privacy (Internet);
- analyze beneficial and harmful effects of computing, connecting computing to economic, social, and cultural contexts and innovations in other fields (impact).
